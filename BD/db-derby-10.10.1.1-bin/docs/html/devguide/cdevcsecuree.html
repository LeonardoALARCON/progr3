<h1 class="topictitle1">Configuring security for
<span>Derby</span></h1>



<div><p><span>Derby</span> can be
deployed in a number of ways and in a number of different environments, ranging
from a single-user deployment for small-scale development and testing to a
multi-user deployment of a large database. For all but the smallest deployments,
however, it is essential to make the
<span>Derby</span> system secure.</p>

<p>To secure a <span>Derby</span>
database or databases, take the following steps.</p>

<ol>
<li>Understand the concept of identity in
<span>Derby</span>.
<p>See <a href="cdevcsecureidentity.html#cdevcsecureidentity">Identity in Derby</a> for
details.</p>
</li>

<li>Understand the basic tasks involved in configuring security in a
client-server environment or an embedded environment.
<p>See <a href="cdevcsecure12392.html#cdevcsecure12392">Basic security configuration tasks</a> for
details.</p>
</li>

<li>Configure <em>authentication</em> by setting up users and passwords.
<p>Authentication determines whether someone is a legal user. It establishes
a user's identity. <span>Derby</span>
verifies user names and passwords before permitting access to the
<span>Derby</span> system.</p>

<p>For more information about authentication, see
<a href="cdevcsecure42374.html#cdevcsecure42374">Working with user authentication</a>.</p>
</li>

<li>Configure <em>user authorization</em> for the system.
<p>Authorization determines what operations can be performed by a user's
<span>Derby</span> identity. 
Authorization grants users or roles permission to read a database or to write
to a database.</p>

<p>For more information about authorization, see
<a href="cdevcsecure36595.html#cdevcsecure36595">User authorizations</a>.</p>
</li>

<li>Encrypt your databases.
<p><span>Derby</span> provides ways to
encrypt data stored on disk.</p>

<p>For more information about encryption, see
<a href="cdevcsecure24366.html#cdevcsecure24366">Encrypting databases on disk</a>.</p>
</li>

<li>Sign any jar files that you use in your databases.
<p><span>Derby</span> validates
certificates for classes loaded from signed jar files.</p>

<p>For more information about using signed jar files, see
<a href="cdevcsecure90988.html#cdevcsecure90988">Signed jar files</a>.</p>
</li>

<li>Encrypt network traffic with SSL/TLS.
<p>SSL/TLS certificate authentication is also supported. See
"Network encryption and authentication with SSL/TLS" in the
<span><em>Derby Server and Administration Guide</em></span> for details.</p>
</li>

<li>Customize the default security policy.
<p>For details, see <a href="cdevcbabejdfj.html#cdevcbabejdfj">Running Derby under a security manager</a>, and
see "Running the Network Server under the security manager" in the
<span><em>Derby Server and Administration Guide</em></span>.</p>
</li>

<li>If necessary, restrict database file access to the operating system account
that started the JVM.
<p>For details, see "Controlling database file access" in the
<span><em>Derby Server and Administration Guide</em></span>.</p>
</li>

</ol>

<p>The section "Derby Network Server advanced topics" in the
<span><em>Derby Server and Administration Guide</em></span> has more information on
security issues. The <span><em>Derby Reference Manual</em></span> describes
many security-related properties and system procedures, as well as such
statements as GRANT, REVOKE, CREATE ROLE, DROP ROLE, CREATE PROCEDURE, and
CREATE FUNCTION.</p>

<ul class="ullinks">
<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="cdevcsecureidentity.html">Identity in Derby</a></strong><br />
Derby provides two kinds of identity, system-wide identity and database-specific identity.</li>
<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="cdevcsecure12392.html">Basic security configuration tasks</a></strong><br />
In most cases, you enable Derby's security features through the use of properties. It is important to understand the best way of setting properties for your environment.</li>
<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="cdevcsecure42374.html">Working with user authentication</a></strong><br />
Derby provides support for user authentication and user authorization. User authentication determines whether a user is a valid user. It establishes the user's identity. User authorization determines what operations a user's established identity can perform. You are strongly urged to implement both authentication and authorization on any multi-user database used in production.</li>
<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="cdevcsecure37241.html">Users and authorization identifiers</a></strong><br />
User names within the Derby system are known as authorization identifiers. The authorization identifier is a string that represents the name of the user, if one was provided in the connection request.</li>
<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="cdevcsecure36595.html">User authorizations</a></strong><br />
When you specify user authorizations, Derby verifies that a user has been granted permission to access a system, database, object, or SQL action.</li>
<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="cdevcsecure24366.html">Encrypting databases on disk</a></strong><br />
Derby provides a way for you to encrypt your data on disk.</li>
<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="cdevcsecure90988.html">Signed jar files</a></strong><br />
In a Java SE environment, Derby can detect digital signatures on jar files. When attempting to load a class from a signed jar file stored in the database, Derby will verify the validity of the signature.</li>
<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="cdevcsecure10983.html">Notes on the Derby security features</a></strong><br />
The Derby security model has some basic limitations.</li>
<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="cdevcsecure51876.html">User authentication and authorization examples</a></strong><br />
This section provides examples that show user authentication and authorization in Derby in either a client/server environment or in an embedded environment.</li>
<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="cdevcbabejdfj.html">Running Derby under a security manager</a></strong><br />
When running within an application or application server with a Java security manager enabled, Derby must be granted certain permissions to execute and access database files.</li>
