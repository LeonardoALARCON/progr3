<h1 class="topictitle1">Decrypting an encrypted database</h1>



<div><p>You can return an encrypted database to an unencrypted state by
specifying attributes on the connection URL.</p>

<p>To decrypt an encrypted database, specify the <em>decryptDatabase=true</em>
attribute in conjunction with either the <em>bootPassword=key</em> attribute or
the <em>encryptionKey=key</em> attribute.</p>

<p>See the <span><em>Derby Reference Manual</em></span> for details on the
connection URL attributes.</p>

<div class="note"><span class="notetitle">Recommendation: </span>Ensure
that you have enough free disk space before you decrypt a database. In addition
to the disk space required for the unencrypted size of the database, temporary
disk space is required to store the encrypted version of the data to restore the
database to its encrypted state if the decryption is interrupted or returns
errors. All of the temporary disk space is released back to the operating
system after the database is decrypted.</div>

<p>You must shut down the database before you decrypt it. An attempt to decrypt
a booted database has no effect.</p>

<p>If the database is configured with log archival, you must disable log
archival in addition to shutting down the database before you can decrypt the
database. You should also create a new backup of the database before you decrypt
it, and create another after you decrypt it. For more information, see the
section "Backing up and restoring databases" in the
<span><em>Derby Server and Administration Guide</em></span>, particularly "Roll-forward
recovery".</p>

<p>If any global transactions are in the prepared state after recovery, the
database cannot be decrypted.</p>

<p>If <a href="cdevcsecure36127.html#cdevcsecure36127">authentication</a>
and <a href="cdevcsecure36595.html#cdevcsecure36595">SQL authorization</a>
are both enabled, the credentials of the 
<a href="cdevcsecureDbOwner.html#cdevcsecureDbOwner">database owner</a>
must be supplied as well, since decryption is a restricted operation.</p>

<p>After you decrypt the database, be sure to check for <em>SQLWarning</em>s. The
decryption succeeded only if there were no <em>SQLWarning</em>s or
<em>SQLException</em>s.</p>
